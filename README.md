## 1. Introduction
This project aims to evaluate and compare the performance of four CNN pre-trained models — VGG16, ResNet50V2, Xception, and InceptionV3 — originally trained on the ImageNet dataset, by fine-tuning them to classify the New 7 Wonders of the World, which include: 
```
1. Great Wall of China 
2. Petra (Jordan) 
3. Christ the Redeemer (Brazil) 
4. Machu Picchu (Peru) 
5. Chichen Itza (Mexico) 
6. Colosseum (Italy) 
7. Taj Mahal (India)
```
 
The main objective is to compare the performance of these four models with and without transfer learning (fine-tuning) to analyze how pre-trained knowledge on large-scale datasets like ImageNet can enhance classification accuracy when adapted to a custom image dataset that the models have never seen before.
 
Finally, the Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) technique is applied to interpret the model’s decision-making process and visualize which image regions most influence the classification. This provides better understanding of
 
Overall, this study aims to explore the effectiveness of transfer learning and CNN visualization techniques in real-world image classification tasks, contributing to both academic learning and practical implementation in computer vision.
 
## 2. Dataset Description

### 2.1 Data Sources
The images were collected from open-source image repositories such as Unsplash, Google Images using keyword-based web scraping. Each category contains a diverse set of photos that vary in lighting conditions, camera angles, weather, and distance, ensuring that the model can generalize across real-world scenarios.

## 3. Data Preparation and Pre-Processing    
Before training, all images were preprocessed as follows:  
- Resizing: Each image was resized to 224×224 pixels to fit the input shape of pre-trained CNN models.
  

- Augmentation technique were applied to increase dataset diversity and reduce overfitting.

- Normalization: Pixel values were scaled to a range of [0, 1] for faster convergence during training
- Data Splitting (Train/ Validation / Test)
  The dataset was then split into three subsets:  
    - Training set: 70% of total (images = 210  images/class)   
    - Validation set: 15% of total (images = 30 images/class)  
    - Test set: 15% of total images (images = 30 images/class)
 
  This dataset serves as a custom, domain-specific dataset that differs significantly from the ImageNet dataset, allowing us to evaluate how well pre-trained CNN architectures can adapt to unseen image domains through fine-tuning.
